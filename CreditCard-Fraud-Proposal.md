### Introduction
There have always been people who would develop new ways to illegally access someone's finances since the payment systems were invented. This has become a huge issue in the current era, as all purchases can now be made quickly and efficiently online with only credit card information.
#### Purpose:
The objective in this project is to build machine learning models to classify or identify fraudulent card transactions from a given card transactions data.
This system will be useful for people who use credit cards and banks to keep their customers safe.


### Data Description
The dataset [CreditCardFraud] (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
Features:
* Time: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset
* V1, V2, ... V28: result of a PCA Dimensionality reduction to protect user identities and sensitive features(v1-v28)
* Amount: the amount of the transaction.
* Class: is the target variable with value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
